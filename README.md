# Coding Challenges

## Intro
* Each challenge is essentially finding a way to transform the given input to the output desired.
</br>

### Steps to Repeat
1. understand the problem (you want to change the input to the output) nothing more nothing less
2. break solution down into steps of pseudocode then ask how for each step
3. test each line to make sure they are doing what you expect them to do
</br> 

### Tips

* Pseudoode is the most important part.

* The more methods you know the better.

* Test each line as you go along and console log to make sure the code does what you want it to

* When things don't work as expected look up the documentation

* Limit time that you are stuck to only 15 minutes

* It is helpful to look at the solution and reverse engineer it if you aren't able to solve it

* Once you've looked at the solution try it again to see how much you've learned

* Each problem can be taken to the next step by trying to understand the Big O of your solutions

  <summary>Strings</summary>
  
  <!-- ## Strings -->
  1. .split('')
    * splits strings on whatever is passed into the parenthesis
    ```javascript
    const str = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.';

    const words = str.split(' ');
    console.log(words);
     Array ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog."]
    ```

<details>
  <summary>Arrays</summary>
  
  1. .sort()
    * sorts arrays by values inside
    * numbers need a helper function because they are sorted as strings
      
    ```javascript
    let fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    // Apple, Banana, Mango, Orange

    let points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
    points.sort(function(a, b){return a - b});
    // 1,5,10,25,40,100
    ```
